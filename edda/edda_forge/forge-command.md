Delegate coding tasks to edda-forge — a sandboxed agent that loops (plan → implement → validate → review) until the code compiles and tests pass, then produces a validated patch. Think of it as delegating to an engineer who returns a tested diff.

Use forge when each subtask is self-contained. Forge runs in an isolated Dagger container, so the user's working tree stays clean until the validated patch is applied.

Aim for the maximum concurrency when possible. Decompose the problem into multiple independent subtasks that can be run in parallel. Sometimes it makes sense to run first task to create core functionality, then run dependent subtasks that build on it. But when subtasks are independent (e.g. separate utility modules, separate test files), run them concurrently to save time (each with a unique --output path). Apply patches sequentially once they are complete.

The problem is: $ARGUMENTS

## 1. Check forge.toml

Look for `forge.toml` in the project root.
If it doesn't exist, detect the project type and create one.

### Concurrent runs with different validation targets

When running multiple forge instances against different test files or modules, create separate config files (e.g. `forge-auth.toml`, `forge-api.toml`) each with a targeted test command. Pass them via `--config`:

```bash
edda-forge --config forge-auth.toml --prompt '...' --source . --output ./forge-auth
edda-forge --config forge-api.toml --prompt '...' --source . --output ./forge-api
```

The configs should differ only in the test step. Keep a single shared `forge.toml` for solo runs.

### Templates

**Rust** (Cargo.toml present):
```toml
[container]

user_setup = """

"""

[container.env]
PATH = "/home/forge/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

**Python** (pyproject.toml present):

setup = ["apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git sudo"]
user = "forge"
user_setup = """

  && echo 'forge ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers \

```

**Python + Rust / maturin** (both pyproject.toml and Cargo.toml, with `[tool.maturin]` or `maturin` in build-system):
```toml
[container]
image = "python:3.12"
setup = [
    "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git sudo build-essential",
]
user = "forge"
user_setup = """

  && echo 'forge ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers \
  && su - forge -c 'curl --proto =https --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y' \
  && su - forge -c 'curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh'
"""

[container.env]
PATH = "/home/forge/.local/bin:/home/forge/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
CARGO_HOME = "/home/forge/.cargo"
RUSTUP_HOME = "/home/forge/.rustup"

[project]
language = "python"
source = "."
workdir = "/app"

[steps]
[[steps.validate]]
name = "sync"
command = "uv sync 2>&1"
[[steps.validate]]
name = "build-rust"
command = "uv run maturin develop 2>&1"
[[steps.validate]]
name = "test"
command = "uv run pytest 2>&1"
```

Note: Rust and uv are installed as the forge user (via `su - forge -c`), not as root. This avoids permission errors when `maturin` or `cargo` run later.

Show the generated forge.toml to the user and ask for confirmation before writing it.

## 2. Run forge

Always specify a unique output path to avoid conflicts between concurrent runs. Derive it from the subtask (e.g. slugified keyword):

```bash
edda-forge --prompt '<the subtask>' --source . --output ./forge-<slug> --max-retries 3
```

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set.

If running multiple forge instances concurrently, launch each in the background and wait for all to complete. Forge tasks take a while, so don't check on them too frequently — give at least 5 minutes to start and get some progress.

### Prompt quality matters

For simple tasks ("add a logging middleware"), a short prompt is fine. For algorithmic or precision-sensitive tasks, **include the exact contract in the prompt** — don't just say "study the test file." Spell out:
- The exact function signatures and return types
- Key invariants and assertions the code must satisfy
- Edge cases (zero weights, NaN handling, empty inputs)

A vague prompt that fails review 3 times wastes more time than a detailed prompt that succeeds on the first try.

### Choosing `--max-retries`

- Simple tasks (wrapping existing APIs, straightforward CRUD): `--max-retries 3`
- Complex tasks (algorithms, precision-sensitive, many edge cases): `--max-retries 5`

## 3. Apply and clean up

On success (exit 0), apply each patch sequentially:
```bash
git apply forge-<slug>.patch && rm forge-<slug>.patch
```

### Handling patch conflicts across concurrent runs

When multiple forge instances modify overlapping files (e.g. `__init__.py`, `conftest.py`), later patches will fail to apply. 

Solutions, in order of preference:

1. **Exclude conflicting files, merge manually.** Apply the patch excluding known conflicts, then hand-merge the conflicting files:
   ```bash
   git apply --exclude='path/to/conflict.py' forge-<slug>.patch
   ```
   Then read the excluded hunks from the patch and apply the relevant parts via Edit.

2. **Commit between patches and use 3-way merge.** After applying each patch, commit it. Then apply the next with `--3way`:
   ```bash
   git apply forge-first.patch && git add -A && git commit -m "apply first"
   git apply --3way forge-second.patch
   ```

3. **Apply smallest/most-independent patches first.** Order by: utility modules → core logic → integration/glue code. The glue patches (which touch shared files like `__init__.py`) should go last.

On forge failure: show the error and suggest the user refine the prompt or adjust forge.toml validation steps.

## 4. Verify

Run the **actual target tests** locally after applying patches — not just a build check. The container environment may differ from local (different random seeds, dependency versions, etc.):

```bash
# Python
uv run pytest tests/ -x -q

# Rust
cargo test

# TypeScript
npm test
```

Show `git diff --stat` so the user can review what changed.

Clean up any leftover forge config and patch files:
```bash
rm -f forge-*.toml forge-*.patch
```
